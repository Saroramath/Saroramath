### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ I am passionate about learning new things and solving problems. I am currently a PhD candidate in Mathematics at [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://www.mun.ca), St. John's. I am working on Geometric Group Theory. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
### Machine learning
I am intereted in finding ways to utilise AI and machine learning for the use of the community. I work with classical ML algorithms as well as training Deep Neural Networks with Tensorflow. Check out this [repository](https://github.com/Saroramath/MachineLearning) to see my notes in the progress.

### Data Visulization
I enjoy making visualizations of the data into interactive plots. It helps users to interact with the data to explore and engage better. I am currently working on the project DataNL to collate data into graphs about NL. Check out the page for more details.

## Web development
I started learning learning web development to be able to convert ideas to working prototypes. I learnt React and Ionic framework for front-end, and
Gatsby and Jekyll for static websites. Currently I am exploring Dash to deploy ML and data science apps. 


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that utilise ML with a positive social impact.
